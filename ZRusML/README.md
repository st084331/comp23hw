### Features done:

- Parser
- Type inferencer
- Compiler
- Interpreter for compiled code
- Unit tests

### Features details:

- Parser based on abstract syntactic tree
- Type inferencer supports generic type, errors check and printing, types printing
- ANF builder, which preliminarily liftes lambdas and converts closures
- LLVM compiler
- Interpreter that collects all stages together, which can successfully execute correct code and notify about errors in incorrect code
- Unit tests for parser, lambda lifting, closure conversion, anf building, type inferencing and LLVM compiler with interpreter

### Mini-language supports

- Int, Bool
- Functions, lambda, recursive functions
- Generic types
- Binary and unary operators, let...in binding, if statements, partially application

and etc., more examples in tests.
