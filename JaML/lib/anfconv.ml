   Some thoughts about anf conversion.

   Let a top-level declaration be called the following:
   let f ... = ....
   let f = ...
   In this case f is a top-level declaration.

   Let the following constructs be called any level declaration:
   let f ... = ...
   let f = ...
   let ... =
   let f = ... in

   In all such cases, f is a declaration at any level.

   All top-level declarations without arguments are considered functions, which
   require 0 arguments to be passed to call them.

   Working with functions adheres to the following rules:
   1. If a top-level declaration with more than zero arguments is returned from
   any level declaration, that top-level declaration is turned into a closure to
   which zero arguments are applied.
   2. If a top-level declaration with zero arguments is returned from any level declaration,
   then that top-level declaration is considered a function to which zero arguments should be
   applied, and it is immediately called, and then we return the result of that application
   from the declaration.
   4. If the top-level declaration represents a higher-order function, it expects any function
   passed to it to be represented by a closure.
   3. If we pass a top-level declaration to a top-level declaration, the caller must
   turn the top-level declaration into a closure to which zero arguments are applied.
   4. If fewer arguments than expected are applied to the top-level declaration, then
   a closure is created from that top-level declaration to which the passed number of
   arguments is applied.
   5. If exactly as many arguments are applied to the top-level declaration as it expects,
   then an application of all arguments to the top-level declaration is called.
   6. If more arguments are applied to the top-level declaration than it expects, we first
   call the application with the arguments that the top-level declaration expects, and then
   apply the arguments to the result using AddArgsToClosure, since we expect the result to
   return a closure.
